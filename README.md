Hey, I'm a fun little guy who likes to do fun little things :)

I work professionally as a smart contract engineer with 4 years of experience cut across Ethereum, Cosmos and Solana. 

When I'm not being subjected to capitalism, I spend my time contributing to open source projects or making mine.

Wanna say hi? text me on discord - perelyn.
